# INF-HatEval at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Convolutional Neural Networks for Hate Speech Detection Against Women and Immigrants on Twitter

### Abstract

Social networks have grown a lot in recent years, a great example is Twitter. Because of this growth, not only has the way we communicated become more practical, there has also been an increase in the exposure of opinions, often controversial and may be offensive, aggressive, rude, hateful, among other derogatory characteristics. In this respect, it has become interesting to develop automatic methods to idendify this type of hate language, and the area called Sentiment Analysis provides several methods for detecting feelings in social networks. Therefore, this article presents a survey on hate speech detection against women and immigrants on Twitter, from a multilingual perspective, English and Spanish. Our system was developed based on a Convolutional Neural Network, making use of word embeddings, in this case GloVe and FastText. The developed one was exposed in front of two tasks, where the first has as objective to classify a tweet in hateful or non-hateful, and the second one has as objective to identify the target of the hateful speech, in the case of being a single individual or group of people.
